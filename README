  ---- Shell build, backup and deploy
       system foundation.

  Synopsis
  --------
  A tool which comes straight to point. Plain shell scripting. Don't
  want to learn a new languages and rules in order to just execute a
  few commands? You feel comfortable with the shell? This is for you.

  Deta consists of three parts:

  * The tool, launches tasks.

  * Functions (organized in classes) for the most common or
    highly repetitive actions.

  * A suggestion for a directory and file structure. This helps
    organizing and sharing tasks between projects.

  Installation and Basic Usage
  ----------------------------
  1. Extract the downloaded archive.

  2. Move or copy the extracted directory davidpersson-deta-[hash]
     to /path/to/your/project/libraries.

  3. Create a `scripts` directory within your project. This is just a
     suggestion - other setups are possible, too.
     $ mkdir /path/to/project/scripts

  4. Link the deta script into your project.
     $ cd /path/to/project/scripts
     $ ln -s ../libraries/deta/deta.sh ./deta

  5. Copy the default configuration into the `scripts` directory.
     $ cp ../libraries/deta/deta.conf .

  6. Create your first task. Task are plain shell files, which are
     included by the deta script.
     $ mkdir sys
     $ $EDITOR sys/check.sh
     {{{
        source $DETA/sys.sh

        sys_check_command rsync
        # ...
     }}}

   7. Run the brandnew task.
      $ ./deta sys/check.sh

  Contributing
  ------------
  If you have some ideas for improving this tool just fork the repository,
  make your changes and when ready send a pull request to notify me about the
  changes you made. I'll review them and see if I can merge them back. Please
  style your code according to the code which is already there.

  Please note that code which is supposed to be merged into this (blessed)
  repository must carry the same header (including the copyright statement) as
  all code in the library and should be free of any @author tags. This may seem
  a little strange at first. But let me explain: Multiple copyright
  holders/licenses complicate things where not necessary. @author tags seem to
  mark sections of code as belonging to, owned or claimed by the specific author.

  As an alternative the project has a dedicated AUTHORS file where every contributor
  is listed with her/his name/nick along with an email address.
