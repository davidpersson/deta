  ---- Shell build, backup and deploy
       system foundation.

  Synopsis
  --------
  Managing an application is executing commands, tasks are highly specific to
  individual applications. Deta supports you in instantly creating tasks in
  plain shell script. No extra abstraction layers where you don't need them but
  a small tool for launching the tasks, a handful of reusable functions and a
  sane configuration management.

  Versions & Requirements
  -----------------------
  0.1 (in progress)

  The BASH (Bourne-Again SHell) is required. Deta is continously
  tested with recent BASH versions on Linux and Darwin.

  Download
  --------
  http://github.com/davidpersson/deta/downloads

  Installation
  ------------
  1. Extract the downloaded archive.

  2. Move or copy the extracted directory davidpersson-deta-[hash]
     to /path/to/your/project/libraries.

  3. Create a `scripts` directory within your project. This is just a
     suggestion - other setups are possible, too.
     $ mkdir /path/to/project/scripts

  4. Link the deta tool into your project.
     $ cd /path/to/project/scripts
     $ ln -s ../libraries/deta/deta.sh ./deta

  5. Copy the default configuration into the `scripts` directory.
     $ cp ../libraries/deta/deta.conf .

  Quickstart
  ----------
  1. Create a subdirectory for our task.
     $ mkdir deploy

  2. Start to edit the new task.
     $ $EDITOR deploy/prepare.sh

  3. Source the core and g11n modules and require a THIS role.
     {{{
       source $DETA/core.sh
       source $DETA/g11n.sh

       role THIS
       # ...
     }}}

  4. Our task will clone the project and recompile all MO files.
     {{{
       # ...
       git clone --verbose --depth 0 file://$THIS_PROJECT $THIS_TMP
       cd $THIS_TMP

       g11n_remove_mo app/locale
       g11n_compile_mo app/locale
     }}}

  5. Run the tasks through the deta tool.
     $ ./deta deploy/prepare.sh

  Terminology
  -----------
  Tasks
  '''''
  Tasks are sourced by the deta tool they automatically have access to all the
  configuration from `deta.conf` and some other global variables. Following
  variables are available: QUIET (y|n), DRYRUN (y|n), DETA (deta directory)

  Tasks are plain shell files and share the same interpreter as the
  deta tool (which is BASH).

  Tasks can be located wherever you want. In the end you just pass the path to
  the deta tool. However it is nice to be able to group tasks, therefore it is
  suggested to create subdirectories directly in the `scripts` directory.

  Modules
  '''''''
  Modules contain sets of functions and are loaded on demand by sourcing
  them in the beginning of each task. Modules shipped with deta are located
  in the directory specified by $DETA. Of course you can also built your own
  modules and load them in a similar way.
  {{{
    source $DETA/core.sh
    source $DETA/sys.sh
    # ...
  }}}

  Environments
  ''''''''''''
  Environments are inspired by the way Lithium[1] detects and handles
  environment configuration. Environments (or env for short) allow you to keep
  host specific configuration settings in one place. You may have an env called
  DEV, STAGE or PROD. The configuration is kept in a dedicated file called
  `deta.conf`.

  [1] Lithium framework, http://lithify.me

  Roles
  '''''
  Environments can _take_ roles. Tasks where you transfer transfer things
  between two machines would require SOURCE and a TARGET roles, whereas tasks
  that just build some stuff locally require a THIS role.

  To indicate that a task requires a role call the role function (from the core
  module) right below the source statements.
  {{{
    source $DETA/core.sh

    role SOURCE
    role TARGET
    # ...
  }}}

  The function will map an env to a role. This means a configuration setting
  available as i.e. DEV_HOST will become also available as THIS_HOST. When the
  env for a role can't be detected automatically it will prompt you for one.

  Envs can be automatically wired to roles within the configuration file. The
  following statement will cause the role function to use the DEV env for the
  THIS role when the current hostname equals the one specified for the DEV env.
  {{{
    # ...
    DEV_THIS=$([[ $(hostname) == $DEV_HOST ]] && echo "y" || echo "n")
    # ...
  }}}

  Contributing
  ------------
  If you have some ideas for improving this tool just fork the repository,
  make your changes and when ready send a pull request to notify me about the
  changes you made. I'll review them and see if I can merge them back. Please
  style your code according to the code which is already there.

  Please note that code which is supposed to be merged into this (blessed)
  repository must carry the same header (including the copyright statement) as
  all code in the library and should be free of any @author tags. This may seem
  a little strange at first. But let me explain: Multiple copyright
  holders/licenses complicate things where not necessary. @author tags seem to
  mark sections of code as belonging to, owned or claimed by the specific author.

  As an alternative the project has a dedicated AUTHORS file where every contributor
  is listed with her/his name/nick along with an email address.
